      <description>GitPitch offers a wide range of slideshow settings that can be used to customize the overall look-and-feel and behavior of any presentation.
To activate custom settings for your slideshow presentation, add a PITCHME.yaml properties file alongside the PITCHME.md file in your repo. Custom settings are optional.

Sample PITCHME.yaml Here is a sample of the custom settings found in the PITCHME.yaml used by the GitPitch Hello World slideshow presentation:</description>

      <description>When you develop slide content using GitPitch markdown you benefit from automatic layout of that content. The default layout policy centers content on your slides. However, if you ever want to change that default layout policy for your slide deck you can activate a custom layout policy in your PITCHME.yaml.
The following screenshot demonstrates the set of available automatic layout policies:

While these automatic layout policies are a great way to get started, GitPitch is unique among markdown presentation solutions in offering support for flexible slide layouts.</description>

Code presenting can be activated for any code block on any slide - whether the code originated as a fenced code-block, a repo source file, or a GitHub GIST.

This feature has great utility for presentation authors as it allows you to focus your audience&amp;rsquo;s attention on key concepts, revealing additional content on the slide only when the time is right.</description>

      <description>Learn By Example Raw Markdown Rendering Limitations  
Learn By Example To display raw Markdown content on a slide you must use a code delimiter. The code delimiter ensures proper encoding of the raw markdown content prior to rendering on the slide. The markdown file referenced on the code delimiter must also have a .md extension.
For example, you can render the contents of the file src/snippet.</description>

By default, GitPitch treats GitHub as the default git repository service a.k.a. GRS.
If you want to view or share a slideshow URL for a presentation published from a GitLab or Bitbucket repository you need to indicate the GRS on the slideshow URL as explained in the following sections.</description>

      <description>Important! Remember to size-optimize your presentation images for the Web.
 Learn By Example  Image delimiter syntax supports a repeat parameter that gives you the ability to have a background image repeated on a slide background.
By default, background images are rendered with a no-repeat pattern. The repeat paramter can take any value that is valid on the background-repeat css property.

      <description>Video files must be served from a video streaming CDN such as YouTube or Vimeo. Your repository on GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket can not be used as a video CDN. However, Pro subscribers can do more.
  Learn By Example  Basic slide delimiter syntax allows markdown content to be split into a series of slides. Special video delimiter syntax allows overriding the basic delimiter semantics in order to display any MP4 or WebM as a background video on specific slides.</description>

      <description>GitPitch Pro + Lite subscriptions activate the Background Image Opacity feature.
  Learn By Example  Important! Remember to size-optimize your presentation images for the Web.
Image delimiter syntax supports an opacity parameter that gives you the ability to apply opacity filters to individual background images.
By default, background images are displayed with 100% opacity. Reducing the opacity level increases the transparency of background images. The more transparent a slide background image, the more other content on the slide - such as text content - stands out.</description>

      <description>To ensure the best possible user experience for visitors to GitPitch slideshow presentations on the Web, a 1Mb file size limit is now enforced for all images displayed inline or as backgrounds on slides.
While we strongly encourage you to size-optimize all image assets used by your GitPitch slideshow presentations, GitPitch now automatically detects, rejects, and reports images that exceed the size-limit directly within your slides.
For example, the following screenshots show how inline and background images that exceed the 1Mb size limit are reported directly within their respective slides:</description>
